      "    \"abstract\": \"Methods used to categorize functional status to predict health outcomes across post-acute care settings vary significantly.\\nWe compared three methods that categorize functional status to predict 30-day and 90-day hospital readmission across inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF), skilled nursing facilities (SNF) and home health agencies (HHA).\\nRetrospective analysis of 2013-2014 Medicare claims data (N = 740,530). Data were randomly split into two subsets using a 1:1 ratio. We used half of the cohort (development subset) to develop functional status categories for three methods, and then used the rest (testing subset) to compare outcome prediction. Three methods to generate functional categories were labeled as: Method I, percentile based on proportional distribution; Method II, percentile based on change score distribution; and Method III, functional staging categories based on Rasch person strata. We used six differentiation and classification statistics to determine the optimal method of generating functional categories.\\nIRF, SNF and HHA.\\nWe included 130,670 (17.7%) Medicare beneficiaries with stroke, 498,576 (67.3%) with lower extremity joint replacement and 111,284 (15.0%) with hip and femur fracture.\\nUnplanned 30-day and 90-day hospital readmission.\\nFor all impairment conditions, Method III best predicted 30-day and 90-day hospital readmission. However, we observed overlapping confidence intervals among some comparisons of three methods. The bootstrapping of 30-day and 90-day hospital readmission predictive models showed the area under curve for Method III was statistically significantly higher than both Method I and Method II (all paired-comparisons, p<.001), using the testing sample.\\nOverall, functional staging was the optimal method to generate functional status categories to predict 30-day and 90-day hospital readmission. To facilitate clinical and scientific use, we suggest the most appropriate method to categorize functional status should be based on the strengths and weaknesses of each method.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Multiple studies have reported nonunion rates of 3% to 17% following peri-prosthetic fractures. Determining management strategies based on the available literature is difficult because existing studies are small and involve heterogeneous treatments and multiple surgeons. The purpose of this study was to describe a consecutive series of patients who presented to the authors' clinic with a periprosthetic nonunion of the lower extremity and to report the methods used to achieve limb salvage and the associated complications. Patients were included if they were indicated for surgery for a nonunion of a periprosthetic fracture of the lower extremity that had previously undergone either closed or open intervention. A total of 26 patients were included in this study. Average follow-up was 58 months. Average age was 69 years, and 77% of the patients were female. Twenty-three patients had periprosthetic nonunions of the femur, with 6 being associated with total hip arthroplasty, 15 with total knee arthroplasty, and 2 with both a total hip arthroplasty and a total knee arthroplasty. Three patients had a periprosthetic nonunion of the tibia associated with a total knee arthroplasty. Limb salvage was successful in 25 of 26 cases. This was achieved by either healing of the nonunion using exuberant fixation with prosthesis revision when necessary (n=20) or resection of the nonunion with placement of a tumor prosthesis (n=5). Four of the 26 patients (15%) incurred at least 1 complication during treatment. Exuberant fixation of the nonunion (with prosthesis revision when necessary) or nonunion resection with placement of a tumor prosthesis was successful in 96% of cases.

      "    \"abstract\": \"The association of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with non-union in long bone fractures has been controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether NSAID exposure results in increased risk of non-union in operatively treated long bone fractures. The authors used International Classification of Diseases and Current Procedural Terminology codes to identify patients under a single-payer private insurance with operatively treated humeral shaft, tibial shaft, and subtrochanteric femur fractures from a large database. Patients were divided into cohorts based on NSAID use in the immediate postoperative period, and nonunion rates were compared. A cost analysis and a multivariate analysis were performed. Between 2007 and 2016, a total of 5310 tibial shaft, 3947 humeral shaft, and 8432 subtrochanteric femur fractures underwent operative fixation. Patients used NSAIDs in the first 90 days postoperatively in 900 tibial shaft, 694 humeral shaft, and 967 subtrochanteric femur fractures. In these patients, nonunion rates were 18.8%, 17.4%, and 10.4%, respectively. When no NSAIDs were used, the rates were 11.4%, 10.1%, and 4.6% for each fracture type, respectively (P<.05). Among patients taking NSAIDs, subtrochanteric femur fractures had a 2.4 times higher risk of nonunion and humeral shaft and tibial shaft fractures both had a 1.7 times higher risk of nonunion (P<.05). Multivariate analysis showed NSAID use to be an independent risk factor in all 3 types. Cost analysis showed a great increase in economic burden (P<.05). This study indicated that NSAID exposure was associated with fracture nonunion. [Orthopedics. 2020;43(x):xx-xx.].\",\n",

The purpose of this study was to assess clinical outcomes of SIFK based on progression to surgical treatment and arthroplasty, and to evaluate the risk factors that increase the progression to arthroplasty.\\nA retrospective review was performed on patients with a diagnosis of SIFK, as confirmed with use of magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Baseline and final radiographs were reviewed. Baseline MRIs were also reviewed for injury characteristics. Failure was defined as progression to surgical treatment or conversion to arthroplasty.\\nTwo hundred twenty-three patients (71% female) with a mean age of 65.1 years were included. SIFK affected 154 femora (69%) and 123 tibiae (55%), with medial compartment involvement in 198 knees (89%); 74% of medial menisci had root or radial tears, with a mean extrusion of 3.6 mm. Varus malalignment was identified in 54 (69%) of 78 knees. Seventy-six (34%) of all patients progressed to surgical intervention at 2.7 years, and 66 (30%) underwent arthroplasty at 3.0 years. The rates of conversion to surgical intervention and arthroplasty increased to 47% (37 of 79; p = 0.04) and 37% (29 of 79; p = 0.09), respectively, in patients with >5 years of follow-up. The 10-year survival rate free of arthroplasty for patients with SIFK on the medial femoral condyle (p < 0.01), SIFK on the medial tibial plateau (p < 0.01), medial meniscal extrusion (p = 0.01), varus alignment (p = 0.02), and older age (per year older; p = 0.003) was significantly higher than the survival rates of those without each respective condition.\\nSubchondral insufficiency fractures predominantly involve the medial compartment of the knee and commonly present with medial meniscal root and radial tears. Approximately one-third of patients progressed to total knee arthroplasty. Baseline arthritis, older age, location of the insufficiency fracture on both the medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau, meniscal extrusion, and varus malalignment were all associated with progression to arthroplasty.\\nPrognostic Level IV.

SIFK affected 154 femora (69%) and 123 tibiae (55%), with medial compartment involvement in 198 knees (89%); 74% of medial menisci had root or radial tears, with a mean extrusion of 3.6 mm. Varus malalignment was identified in 54 (69%) of 78 knees. Seventy-six (34%) of all patients progressed to surgical intervention at 2.7 years, and 66 (30%) underwent arthroplasty at 3.0 years. The rates of conversion to surgical intervention and arthroplasty increased to 47% (37 of 79; p = 0.04) and 37% (29 of 79; p = 0.09), respectively, in patients with >5 years of follow-up. The 10-year survival rate free of arthroplasty for patients with SIFK on the medial femoral condyle (p < 0.01), SIFK on the medial tibial plateau (p < 0.01), medial meniscal extrusion (p = 0.01), varus alignment (p = 0.02), and older age (per year older; p = 0.003) was significantly higher than the survival rates of those without each respective condition.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Although dietary calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K are nutritional factors associated with osteoporosis, little is known about their effects on incident osteoporotic fractures in East Asian populations. This study aimed to determine whether intakes of these nutrients predict incident osteoporotic fractures. We adopted a cohort-study design with a 5-year follow-up. Subjects were 12,794 community-dwelling individuals (6,301 men and 6,493 women) aged 40-74 years. Dietary intakes of calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K were assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. Covariates were demographic and lifestyle factors. All incident cases of major osteoporotic limb fractures, including those of the distal forearm, neck of humerus, neck or trochanter of femur, and lumbar or thoracic spine were collected. Hazard ratios (HRs) for energy-adjusted calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K were calculated with the residual method. Mean age was 58.8 years (SD=9.3). Lower energy-adjusted intakes of calcium and vitamin K in women were associated with higher adjusted HRs of total fractures (P for trend=0.005 and 0.08, respectively). When vertebral fracture was the outcome, P for trend values for calcium and vitamin K were 0.03 and 0.006, respectively, and HRs of the lowest and highest (reference) intake groups were 2.03 (95%CI:1.08-3.82) and 2.26 (95%CI:1.19-4.26), respectively. In men, there were null associations between incident fractures and each of the three nutrient intakes. Lower intakes of dietary calcium and vitamin K were independent, lifestyle-related risk factors for osteoporotic fracture in women but not men. These associations were robust for vertebral fractures, but not for limb fractures.\",\n",

      "surgical treatment and arthroplasty, and to evaluate the risk factors that\n",
      "increase the progression to arthroplasty.\n",
      "METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on patients with a diagnosis of\n",
      "SIFK, as confirmed with use of magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Baseline and\n",
